# Code Analysis: Numerical Computing and Machine Learning Library

Based on my exploration of the folder, this appears to be a **numerical computing and machine learning library written in Racket**. Here's what each file contains:

## Overview of the Codebase

This is a mathematical/scientific computing library focused on linear algebra, optimization, and data visualization. The modules are well-organized and build upon each other:

### **Core Modules:**

1. **`utility.rkt`** - Foundation utilities
   - Type checking (`scalar?`)
   - String formatting (`fformat`, `left-pad`)
   - Random sampling functions (`sample-sequence`, `sample-vectors`)
   - Symbol-to-function conversion

2. **`vector.rkt`** - Vector operations
   - Element-wise arithmetic (`v+`, `v-`, `v*`)
   - Vector reductions and folding
   - Normalization and norm calculations
   - Vector conversion utilities (`to-vector`)

3. **`tensor.rkt`** - Multi-dimensional arrays
   - Tensor creation and manipulation (`uv/make-tensor`, `uv/tensor-ref`)
   - Tensor operations (mapping, folding, binary operations)
   - Shape and rank calculations
   - Kernel operations for element-wise transformations

### **Mathematical Computing:**

4. **`calculus.rkt`** - Calculus operations
   - Numerical gradient computation (`uv/gradient`) using finite differences
   - Linear equation functions (`uv/line`, `uv/line-eq`)
   - Element-wise squaring operations (`uv/sqr`)

5. **`optimization.rkt`** - Machine learning optimization
   - Gradient descent implementations (basic and adaptive)
   - Loss functions (L2 loss, line loss)
   - Hyperparameter management system
   - Specialized functions for linear regression

### **Visualization:**

6. **`plot.rkt`** - Data visualization
   - Scatter plots (`scatter-plot`)
   - Line plots (`line-plot`) 
   - Combined scatter+line plots (`line-scatter-plot`)
   - File export capabilities for JPEG output

## Key Features

- **Linear Regression**: Complete pipeline from data to trained models
- **Gradient Descent**: Multiple variants including adaptive learning rates
- **Tensor Operations**: Multi-dimensional array support
- **Numerical Differentiation**: Automatic gradient computation
- **Data Visualization**: Built-in plotting capabilities
- **Hyperparameter Management**: Global parameter system for optimization
